### Hi, I'm Blake!

I'm a student in Engineering 1 at McMaster University. I have completed a few projects which you can find here, including a few on natural growth (See [Veritasium Population Simulation](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/Veritasium_Population_Simulation) and [Sheep Simulator](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/SheepSimulator)).

I am looking to specialize in Mechatronics or Engineering Physics, and want to research and develop efficient ways to produce and use electricity.
