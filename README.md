I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University. I am currently writing C++ firmware as the [Firmware Lead for Mac Formula Electric](https://github.com/macformula/racecar).

Check out my project portfolio <https://blakefreer.github.io/>.

# Embedded

- [asp](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/asp/tree/main), a custom assembler for a stepper motor ASIP
- [All of the Lights](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/AllOfTheLights), a hackathon project which won [best hardware hack at DeltaHacks8](https://devpost.com/software/all-of-the-lights-b31saz)
- [Implementing UART communication using an LED and photoresistor](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/LED-Serial). 

# Mathematics

I'm also pursuing a second degree in pure mathematics and have found programming to be an excellent tool to help visualize and share my learnings. 

- [Linear Least Squares polynomial fitter in Rust](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/Playground/tree/main/rust/linear_least_squares).
- I have two projects related to dynamical systems.
    - The logistic map in [Chaotic Growth Simulation](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/Veritasium_Population_Simulation).
    - Biological systems demonstrating the effects of genetic advantages in [Sheep Simulator](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/SheepSimulator).
