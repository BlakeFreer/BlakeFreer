### Hi, I'm Blake!

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University. I am passionate about embedded systems, so check out my [All of the Lights](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/AllOfTheLights) hackathon project which won [best hardware hack at DeltaHacks8](https://devpost.com/software/all-of-the-lights-b31saz), or my [implementation of UART communication using an LED and photoresistor](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/LED-Serial). Currently, I am working on [ArduinoPLC](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/ArduinoPLC) which allows an Arduino to be used as a PLC with a full tag database management system and (eventually) a graphical Human Machine Interface (HMI).

I am also pursuing a second degree in pure mathematics and have found programming to be an excellent tool to help visualize and share my learnings. I have two projects related to dynamical systems: The logistic map in [Chaotic Growth Simulation](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/Veritasium_Population_Simulation) and biological systems demonstrating the effects of genetic advantages in [Sheep Simulator](https://github.com/BlakeFreer/SheepSimulator).
